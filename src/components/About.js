                        I am a software developer with an innate desire to learn and discover new ways to solve problems. Through my experience as a consultant, I discovered my passion for focusing on key details to deliver high quality products. My client-facing role has allowed me to understand the bigger picture and ask the right questions to achieve efficient solutions.
